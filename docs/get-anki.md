## Download Anki

To use flashcards from any `*docs-as-flashcards` project, you'll need to download Anki, a popular, free, open-source flashcard app.

**‚ùóWARNING:** Don't download `ankiapp`! As far as I'm aware, `ankiapp` isn't malware, but they more or less ripped Anki, which is free, for a paid version of the same. `ankiweb` is legit, it's the official and original version of Anki. See [AnkiWeb.net](https://ankiweb.net/about). Also note that [apps.ankiweb.net](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), the official download link, is different than `ankiapp` (which I won't link here for obvious reasons).

### Ways to download the official Anki app:

- For your phone from your favorite mobile app store
- For your desktop from Chocolatey (if you're a Windows user, Chocolatey is a fantastic way to manage your computer's software)
- For your desktop from the internet (from [apps.ankiweb.net](https://apps.ankiweb.net/))
