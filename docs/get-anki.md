## Download Anki

To use flashcards from any `*-docs-as-flashcards` project, you'll need to download Anki, a popular, free, open-source flashcard app.

**‚ùóWARNING:** Don't download "AnkiApp"! As far as I'm aware, AnkiApp isn't malware, but they more or less ripped off the real (and free) Anki, for a paid version of the same. AnkiWeb on the other hand is legit, it's the official and original (and free) version of Anki. See [AnkiWeb.net](https://ankiweb.net/about) to learn more. Also see [apps.ankiweb.net](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), the official download link for Anki Desktop

### Ways to download the official Anki app:

- For your phone from your favorite mobile app store
- For your desktop from Chocolatey (if you're a Windows user, Chocolatey is a fantastic way to manage your computer's software)
- For your desktop from the internet (from [apps.ankiweb.net](https://apps.ankiweb.net/))
