## Keeping it simple

Anki is a powerful app. It offers many types of advanced flashcard formats (Cloze, for example). The ones used by `*-docs-as-flashcards` are the simplest of the simple; a single flashcard definition in `.md` corresponds to a single flashcard in Anki.

### Conventions

- Flashcards should be short and punchy; not open-ended
  - Each question has a terse and distinct answer
- One portion of the docs corresponds to one flashcard
  - I copy-paste the docs into a new `.md` file, split the concepts into distinct flashcards, and where necessary add context and arrange the wording so that it fits a Q&A format
  - This workflow ensures that the flashcard deck is comprehensive, and that the flashcard language mirrors the official docs as closely as possible
- Concepts are prioritized

❗**Important**: One "concept" about this project you need to know; the point is to *read* the docs. The flashcards themselves are secondary to this goal. Look at each flashcard, linger on it, and feel good about marking the card as complete. Trying to memorize these flashcards verbatim is probably not the most productive use of time, except for perhaps a few key concepts that you find highly interesting or applicable as you progress through the deck.

❗**Important**: Anki lets you read through flashcards in order, or in randomized order. I write these flashcards so that they'll make sense even in random order, but consider what might make the most sense for your needs, and keep in the back of your mind that this setting exists.

### Observations

- Tutorials, how-to's, examples, samples, and so on are great! Just not for flashcards. The point of `*-docs-as-flashcards` is make it easier to pound information into your head so that you know all the pieces of the puzzle
  - There's this concept of Higher Order Thinking Skills, or HOTS ([Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_thinking)) that makes sense (to me) when it comes to organizing my learning journey. Not that it's the way you like to think about it. But if you look at the linked image of Bloom's taxonomy, you'll see "remember" is the first step of the process. *Then* you get to understand, apply, analyze, evaluate, and create (i.e. write code using the concepts)
  - You can always use techniques other than (or in addition to) flashcards, but can't get around that first step
  - It's possible to make documentation about tutorials into flashcards, but at a certain point your time is better spent actually following the tutorials
  - I recommend getting all the little bits of information committed to memory with flashcards, then getting keyboard time by following up on all the other cool resources
