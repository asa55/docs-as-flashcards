# The `*-docs-as-flashcards` Project

There are several GitHub repos that support the `*-docs-as-flashcards` project. Instead of making you navigate to each one individually, [this webpage](https://asa55.github.io/docs-as-flashcards/) is your one-stop-shop to peruse and download all the flashcard decks currently available.

### Quickstart

- Download the free open-source Anki app
- Download flashcards from any `*-docs-as-flashcards` repository (see "Releases") (links below)
- Import flashcards into Anki

and that's it! You're up and running.

### Why `*-docs-as-flashcards` exists

Docs are boring but very important. I'm a working professional, so 101's and bootcamps don't cut it anymore. Still, my eyes glaze over when I start reading docs I'm not familar with (it gets easier when I'm simply referencing the docs while writing code, but it takes time and effort to get to that point). I am building these flashcards manually to reflect official docs (for topic I care about) as closely as possible while following good flashcard conventions, to get over that initial hurdle. These flashcard decks are built using GitHub Actions for my convenience, but it also means it's easy for me to share them. If you're interested in any of these topics, feel free to download a deck and start using it. If you want to see more from a project, reach out to me via that project's issues section. There is a relatively mature roadmap (project board) in each repository to track the topics I intend to add in the future. Hope you enjoy. If you like this project doing and want to see more of it, consider giving this project a ‚≠ê in GitHub to show your interest, a link to the repository can be found at the top right of this page
