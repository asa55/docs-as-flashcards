### Why `*-docs-as-flashcards` exists

Docs are boring but very important. I'm a working professional, 101's and bootcamps don't cut it anymore. Still, my eyes glaze over when I start reading docs (at least initially). Forcing myself to sit down for a read has proved... unproductive. I needed a better way to ensure my eyes land on all the information, and linger on it long enough for my brain to internalize everything. So now I am building flashcards that closely mirror the official docs to help me get over that initial hurdle for many technologies, and for future reference. These flashcard decks are built using GitHub Actions for my convenience, but it also means it's easy for me to share them with you. If you're interested in any of these technologies, feel free to download and use any of the flashcard decks provided below.

There is a GitHub repository for each; if you want to see more from a particular flashcard deck, or if you've identified an issue, please feel free to reach out to me via that project's Issues section. There is a relatively mature roadmap (project board) in each repository to track the topics I intend to add in the future. A link to [the `docs-as-flashcards` repository](https://github.com/asa55/docs-as-flashcards) can be found at the top-right of this page. If you like what this project doing and want to help push it forward, consider giving this project a ‚≠ê in GitHub to show your interest
