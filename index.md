# The `*-docs-as-flashcards` Project

There are several codebases that support this project. The `docs-as-flashcards` repository provides a static website (built with GitHub Pages) that you can browse to learn more about the project, here: https://asa55.github.io/docs-as-flashcards/

### Quickstart

- download the free open-source Anki app
- download flashcards from any `*-docs-as-flashcards` repository (see "Releases") (links below)
- import flashcards into Anki

and that's it! You're up and running.

### Why `*-docs-as-flashcards` exists

Docs are boring but very important. Flashcards can help keep your eyes from glazing over as you start digging into official documentation to learn new concepts and/or refresh your memory. I am building these flashcards manually to reflect official docs (for topic I care about) as closely as possible while following good flashcard conventions. These flashcard decks are built using GitHub Actions for my convenience, but it also means it's easy for me to share them. If you're interested in any of these topics, feel free to download a deck and start using it. If you want to see more from a project, reach out to me via that project's issues section. There is a relatively mature project board to track what topics I intend to add in the future per each project, you'll see that in the Projects tab here, and in each appropriate `*-docs-as-flashcards` repository. Hope you enjoy. If you like this project doing and want to see more of it, consider giving this project a ‚≠ê in GitHub to show your interest
