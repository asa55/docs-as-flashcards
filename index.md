# The `*-docs-as-flashcards` Project

For working professionals bored to tears by docs who need to learn them anyways üò≠

(At least the docs I care about :)

### Quickstart

- First, download the **free** open-source Anki flashcard app
  - For desktop from [Anki's website](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) or [Chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/anki/)
  - Or for mobile from any app store (my preference ü§†)
- Then, [download flashcard decks here](./docs/downloads)
  - Or from any `*-docs-as-flashcards` repository
- Last, from Anki, import flashcards
  - And that's it! You're up and running.

### Roadmap

There is a relatively mature roadmap (project board) in each repository to track the topics I intend to add in the future.  See all [`*-docs-as-flashcards` project roadmaps here](https://github.com/asa55/docs-as-flashcards/projects?query=is%3Aopen)

### Why `*-docs-as-flashcards` exists

Docs are boring but very important. I'm a working professional, 101's and bootcamps don't cut it anymore. So I am building flashcards that closely mirror the official docs to help me get over that initial hurdle for technologies I need to learn, and for my own future reference.

I focus mostly on technologies surrounding the Microsoft ecosystem - these flashcards are more like an _interactive reading of the docs_, than proper flashcards, mirroring official documentation as faithfully as possible. The point is to trick myself into actually paying attention to what I'm reading.
